Abstract:

There is increasing evidence for a major and critical involvement of lipids in
signal transduction and cellular trafficking, and this has motivated large-
scale studies on lipid pathways. The Lipid Metabolites and Pathways Strategy
consortium is actively investigating lipid metabolism in mammalian cells and
has made available time-course data on various lipids in response to treatment
with KDO(2)-lipid A (a lipopolysaccharide analog) of macrophage RAW 264.7
cells. The lipids known as eicosanoids play an important role in inflammation.
We have reconstructed an integrated network of eicosanoid metabolism and
signaling based on the KEGG pathway database and the literature and have
developed a kinetic model. A matrix-based approach was used to estimate the
rate constants from experimental data and these were further refined using
generalized constrained nonlinear optimization. The resulting model fits the
experimental data well for all species, and simulated enzyme activities were
similar to their literature values. The quantitative model for eicosanoid
metabolism that we have developed can be used to design experimental studies
utilizing genetic and pharmacological perturbations to probe fluxes in lipid
pathways.
